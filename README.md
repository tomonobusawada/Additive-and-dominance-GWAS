# additive and dominance GWAS
This repository provides scripts for joint association testing for additive and dominance genetic effects. The provided simulated genotype data will be used as an input.

--Steps
1. The genotype simulation is based on 
LD structure was simulated AR(1).
The resulting additive and domiancne genotypes are mutually uncorrelated.
